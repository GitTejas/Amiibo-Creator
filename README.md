Super Secret AmiiBros.
Welcome to Super Secret AmiiBros., a frontend web application for submitting and voting on your favorite Amiibos from the Super Smash Bros. series. This app allows you to create new Amiibos, vote for your favorites, and filter the Amiibos based on different criteria.

Functionality
Amiibo Management: Create new Amiibos by filling out the form with a name, image URL, and a description of the Amiibo's use.

Voting: Cast your vote for your favorite Amiibos by clicking the "VOTE!" button. The app keeps track of the number of votes each Amiibo receives.

Filtering: Sort and display the Amiibos based on different options such as ascending order, descending order, or the default order.

Authorization: Grant access to the Amiibo creation form by clicking the "Grant Access?" button. This feature adds an element of secrecy to the app.
